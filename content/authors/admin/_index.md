## About Me

I am a PhD student in Clinical and Developmental Psychology at University of Oregon, working with Dr. Sheila Crowell. My research examines how social and psychological factors influence health behavior and well-being. I use a combination of experimental methods, surveys, and longitudinal designs to understand these processes.

I am particularly interested in how personality traits and social relationships shape health outcomes over time. My current projects investigate stress, coping, and resilience in diverse populations.

Before starting my PhD, I completed my BA in Psychology at Undergraduate University, where I developed my passion for research through work in behavioral science labs and an honors thesis project.
